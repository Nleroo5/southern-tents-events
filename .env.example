# IMPORTANT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# ================================
#
# 1. Create a Gmail App Password:
#    - Go to your Google Account settings
#    - Navigate to Security
#    - Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
#    - Click on "App passwords"
#    - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
#    - Enter "Southern Tents Website" as the name
#    - Click "Generate"
#    - Copy the 16-character password and paste it as EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD above
#
# 2. Set your Gmail address:
#    - Replace "your-email@gmail.com" with the Gmail account you want to use
#    - This should be the same account where you generated the app password
#
# 3. Rename this file:
#    - Copy this file and name it ".env" (without the .example)
#    - The .env file is already in .gitignore so it won't be committed
#
# 4. Security Note:
#    - NEVER commit the .env file to git
#    - NEVER share your app password
#    - The app password is different from your regular Gmail password
